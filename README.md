Learning without practice, BORING.


Wanna practice how to use database? 
Below are some level challenges with increasing difficulty. Complete them, and master the DB.

Use whichever stack or language you are familiar with sql or nosql, python or brainfuck. Complete and test the require REST api functions described in each level. Become a master of DB in that stack. 

NOTE: add gitignore while creating each variant of a problem
